### <ins>Vertical scaling & Horizantal scaling</ins>
When no of users increases, the capacity of server also need to be increases inorder to serve them. <br />
This can be done in 2 ways.
#### 1. Vertical scaling

#### 2. Horizantal scaling

### <ins>Load balancer</ins>
Load balancer is needed when Horizantal scaling is implemented, inorder to ditribute the load between servers.

### <ins>Load balancing algorithms to distribute the load</ins>
#### 1. Round robin

#### 2. Session persistence
The requests are trasnferred in the same way as they were transferred in case of round robin algorithm, but here, the load balance maintains <br /> 
a memory regariding which server is handling request of which client, so that the next time when the request comes from same client, <br /> 
it will be transferred to the same server which handled the previous request of that client.

#### What happens if one of the server goes down?
There are 2 ways to handle this.
1. Keep the session information always in the request
2. Let the Load balander take care of "What to do when one of the server goes down".
Will deep dive into this topic later, not everything at a time ðŸ¤£
