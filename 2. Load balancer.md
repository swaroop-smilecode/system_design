#### Algorithms to distribute the load
1. Round robin -- Preferred when requests are coming consistently
2. Latest connections -- Preferred when requests are coming inconsistently
3. IP hash -- When guarantee is needed that particular user gets connected to particular
   node always(session persistence).
