### What is Database & Caching?
Let's consider, <mark>User 1</mark> is making a request to get latest posts. Here, you are querying all the data of company, which will 
take significant amount of time.

So, before returning this data to User 1, let's store in separate database named caching database.

Next time when another user makes the same request, then the Web server retrieves the data from Caching database. Remember that the 
Caching database only that data which was reqested by users previously. So, data quantity is low, which inturn results in significant 
low times in retreiving the data. That's the idea of caching.

### Note
It's important to note that the caching service need not to be restricted to caching only the requests to database. 
In your system, whereever there is a significant amount of time is taking to process the data, that data can be cached.
