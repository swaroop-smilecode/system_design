### What is system_designing?
It's the process of converting the document which consists of Functional requirements & Non functional requirements 
into an system architecture diagram as shown below.

#### Functional requiremnts:
- These are the things which inform about, what the user can do with system.
- A system which can handle only functional requirements will have 2 layers.
  1. Logic layer
  2. Data layer
- The code present in logic layer manipulates the data present inside the data layer.
  This manipulation of data can be done either by user/ by batch job.

#### Non functional requirements:
- Example: System should have 99.99% of availability.
- There are 3 basic non functional requirements.
  1. Scalability: System should be capable of serving n number of users at a time.
  2. Performance: Scalability & Performance will go hand in hand. It means, when you make the system scalable,
     it should not decrease the performance of system.
  4. Availability: System should be available 99.99% of the time.
